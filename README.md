BusHub 🚍
A Bus Booking Platform Using C++ Data Structures
BusHub is a console-based application developed in C++ to manage bus bookings efficiently using core data structures. It offers a structured and interactive way to search, book, and manage bus journeys.

🌟 Features
Search for Buses:
Search buses by departure and destination cities using efficient search algorithms.
Bus Booking:
Book buses with details like passenger count (adults, children, women).
Calculate total fare dynamically.
Booking Management:
View all bookings, cancel bookings, and manage records interactively.
Data Structure Utilization:
Linked List: Manage booking records.
Binary Search Tree (BST): Store and search buses efficiently.
Queue/Stack: Handle seat allocation and cancellations.
Hash Tables: Store user credentials securely.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++
Libraries: Standard C++ libraries (e.g., <iostream>, <vector>, <map>)
Data Structures: Linked Lists, Trees, Hash Tables, Queues, and Stacks.
📂 Project Overview
Core Functionalities:

Bus Search: Leverages BST for fast lookups.
Booking System: Uses linked lists to manage user bookings.
Seat Management: Tracks seat availability with arrays or queues.
Data Storage: Implements hash tables for user credentials and authentication.
User-Friendly Console Interface:

Simple menus to interact with the application.
Clear prompts for user input and error handling.

📄 Future Enhancements
Add a file system for persistent data storage.
Implement a graphical interface.
Add support for advanced search filters (e.g., time, fare range).
